This folder contains master files for AOB.

For each test case, there are 2 master files, one for stdout and the other
for stderr.  The file name of master files follows the convention below:
<test_case_name>.<options>.out
<test_case_name>.<options>.err

If no options needed, the following file names are used:
<test_case_name>.out
<test_case_name>.err
