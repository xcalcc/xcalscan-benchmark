# CVE Case Guidance

## Goal
To give a common practise to compose a benchmark test case from known CVE bugs.

## Steps

### Step 1: Find out CWE number for benchmark test set
(Easy) Check benchmark/README.md to get CWE number. For example, NPD is CWE-476.

### Step 2: Search CVEs according to CWE number
(Easy) Visit website and replace the CWE number as below:
https://www.opencve.io/cve?cwe=CWE-476

### Step 3: Choose a CVE according to the "Products".
(Easy) Choose popular products as much as possible.

### Step 4: Find out the commit (source code change) for this CVE
(Medium) Review the CVE detail and find out the commit (source code change)

### Step 5: Construct a case with the same error pattern
(Hard) Compare the old and new code to construct the case

### Step 6: Validate the case
(Medium) Validate the case with xvsa to make sure the case can be compiled successfully and expected error is reported. If the case is confirmed to be correct but xvsa failed to compile or report error, file bug to core team.

### Step 7: Add the case to benchmark
(Easy) Add source file, master (expected) stdout/stderr file into benchmark. Commit to gerrit/gitlab.
